## Introduction 1.0 

The architecture of modern computer systems include a CPU (Central Processing Unit), Motherboard, Cache, RAM, Main Memory, PSU (Power Supply Unit), Chipset. The CPU is based on the von newmann technology. 

This report is divided into main sections;

	**1.1 Computer components poster** 

	**1.2 Traffic Light Tutorial** 

## 2.0 Computer System Components and Subsystems

2.1 This poster was created using the Gimp 2.0 open source application, similar to Adobe Photoshop but is freeware. 
The poster is defined by 4 attributes;

* The Main Subsystems of a modern computer system
* The memory hierarchy 
* Von Neumann architecture 
* Input/Output system also known as the bios

## 3.0 Traffic Light Program

A 8 byte CPU simulator was used to design a UK law abiding traffic light system, this system had two individual light trees and 6 individual lights controlled by a byte, however the CPU simulator uses hexidecimal/base 16 and needed the binary to be converted from binary/base 2 before its implementation into the code.

3.1 Insert tutorial here how it works and how it was designed with screen shots and how the hex and binary counter works. 

3.2 How real life traffic lights work and how the binary was established

3.2 Procedure, different registers AL, BL control unit, ALU, architecture 8 bit.

## 4.0 Evaluation of CPU ops/ Analysis of CPU ops

this analysis is based on the traffic lights program, fetch cpu interrupts ALU mathematical ops
assembly codes synchronous and asynchronous what happened when sped up or slowed down. user memory ram example the traffic light system. RAM Architecture. 

4.1 Evaluation of CPU performance within the 8 bit architecture of the simulator. How much RAM, space and functions where used?

4.2 Fetch, decode, execute. Short definition and how it works in the simulator

4.3 ALU ops and interrupts. based on traffic lights 

## 5.0 Conclusions

the architecture of the cpu simulator used for traffic lights as a result this architecture doesn't allow the main points that can be concluded.
